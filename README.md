My first attempt at vibe coding, I mess with models like Illustrious XL, Chroma &amp; Z-Image Turbo, and needed a library-like space to keep my prompts, so I "made" this app which can not just save them privately, but also aid you in making new prompts with features like Danbooru tag autocomplete. If you dig this &amp; want to support me, head to my Ko-Fi!
